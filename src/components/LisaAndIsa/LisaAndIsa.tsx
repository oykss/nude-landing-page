					Hey, here are some important things you should know ðŸ‘‹ <br />
					<strong>
						Our investing products (e.g. Nude Stocks & Shares LISA and ISA)
					</strong>
					<br />
					If you open a Nude Stocks & Shares Lifetime ISA, itâ€™s important that
					you know the value of your investment could go up as well as down. You
					could get back less than you put in, which means it would take you
					longer to buy your first home. Past performance is not necessarily a
					guide to the future and investing is not intended to be a short-term
					option. We canâ€™t and donâ€™t provide financial advice so please be sure
					that investment risk is right for you. <br />
					<strong>Our LISA and ISA</strong> <br />
					The 25% bonus and tax-free benefits of these accounts depend on
					government policy and tax rules, which can change at any time.
					<br />
					<strong>Market-leading interest rate</strong> The term market-leading
					interest rate is based on our research as at 03/11/2022.
